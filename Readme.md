# Readme

A minimal but functional tile-based 2d game the likes of the good ol' Pokemon Gameboy version.
Some movement and collision supported.

Using:
- Java 8
- the now mostly deprecated AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit).
(Better use Swing now, Java 9+.)

made in ~2017, based on the tutorial by CodeNMore (Thank you!):

Mainly uploading it for a friend that wanted to study it.
maybe it will be useful to others.
